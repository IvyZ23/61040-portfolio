## Problem Statement

**Trips and Vacation** - I find traveling very fun, esspcially with friends and family. It's a great way to unwind, explore places I've never gone before, and gain new experiences.

### Problem

**Disorganized Group Trip Planning** - Group trips and traveling with friends and family sounds fun, but planning for them is often not. Planning for a trip is a complicated task that requires many steps, from finding a hotel to planning itineraries. When traveling with family and friends, this task can become more difficult, adding on the new issue of accommodating everyone's preferences and budgets.

### Stakeholders

-   Trip Participants – friends or family who want to go on trips together but struggle with the coordination process
-   Trip Organizers – person in the group who usually takes on the responsibility of coordinating logistics and faces most of the stress.
-   Travel Service Providers (airlines, hotels, activity companies) – affected when group bookings get delayed, changed, or canceled because of unorganized planning
