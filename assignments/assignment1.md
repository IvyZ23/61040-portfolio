2. Art - Creating and keeping track of process for art pieces
3. Games - Finding teammates for games or finding new games to play
4. Meals - Keeping track of nutrition, maintaining a healthy diet, or find new recipes to try
5. **Plants** - I have many plants at home and taking care of them can get difficult. Each plant requires different care. Some require to be watered frequently and others don't. Each plant thrives in different environments (temperature, amount of sunlight, humidity, etc), and as my plant collection grows, making sure each plant is getting the care it needs can get complicated.
6. **Campus Life** - Being on campus with so many students can get hectic and can often lead to personal of social challenges. Navigating academics, social relationships, and day-to-day logistics can often get overwhelming and affect a student's wellbeing.
7. Pets - Taking care of pets
8. TV shows/movies - Keep track of shows watched/watching, find new shows, recommend shows
9. Money - Budgeting and handling money responsibly
10. **Travel** - Planning for a trip is a complicated task that requires many steps, from finding a hotel to planning itineraries. When traveling with family and friends, this task can become more difficult, adding on the new issue of accommodating to everyone's preferences and priorites.

## Problems

### Plants

1. [Excluded] Forgetting to water plants
    - Excluded because taking care of a plant does not only entail watering in proper intervals
2. [Included] Plant Care - Forgetting the type of care each plant requires
    - Included because keeping in mind the care each type of plant requires is important to keeping them alive. Different plants have different requirements for the amount of sunlight and water they receive. They also differ in the environment needed (amount of sunlight, soil type, etc). Keeping track of these would ensure that each plant is getting the care it needs.
3. [Excluded] Encountering unknown plant
    - Excluded because there exists apps that help identify items well already (e.g. Google Lens).

### Campus Life

1. [Included] Finding a Compatible Roommate - Getting a roommate you're not compatible with
    - Included because most students would experience having a roommate at their time at MIT (required to dorm on campus for freshman year). Although every student fills out a form about their preferences (sleep schedule, etc), this does not guarantee that the roommate that the system assigns them would be compatible with the student.
2. [Included] Lost and Found - Losing items on campus
    - Included because of how often students lose an item. When lost items are found, they're often turned in (e.g. to the front desk of a dorm). However, the item's owner might have trouble searching for the item, whether it be that they're still searching the location where they lost it (without the knowledge that the item has been turned in) or if they simply don't know where they lost it.
3. [Excluded] Finding campus sales (e.g. move out sales)
    - Excluded because it doesn't pose a great inconvenience to students. Searching on dormspam works fine.

### Travel

1. ## [Excluded] Budgeting for a trip
2. ## [Excluded] Planning the itinerary for a trip
3. ## [Excluded] Planning a group trip
