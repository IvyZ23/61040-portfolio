## Problems

### Plants

1. [Excluded] Forgetting to water plants
    - Excluded because taking care of a plant does not only entail watering in proper intervals
2. [Included] Plant Care - Forgetting the type of care each plant requires
    - Included because keeping in mind the care each type of plant requires is important to keeping them alive. Different plants have different requirements for the amount of sunlight and water they receive. The enviroment each plant needs (amount of sunlight, soil type, etc) to thrive is also different. Keeping track of these would ensure that each plant is getting the care it needs.
3. [Excluded] Encountering unknown plant
    - Excluded because there exists apps that help identify items well already (e.g. Google Lens). Furthermore, it would require machine learning to classify pictures of plants.

### Campus Life

1. [Included] Finding a Compatible Roommate - Getting a roommate you're not compatible with
    - Included because most students would experience having a roommate at their time at MIT (required to dorm on campus for freshman year). Although every student fills out a form about their preferences (sleep schedule, etc), this does not guarantee that the roommate the system assigns them would be compatible.
2. [Included] Lost and Found - Losing items on campus
    - Included because of how often students lose an item. When lost items are found, they're often turned in (e.g. to the front desk of a dorm). However, the item's owner might have trouble searching for the item, whether it be that they're still searching the location where they lost it (without the knowledge that the item has been turned in) or if they simply don't know where they lost it.
3. [Excluded] Finding campus sales (e.g. move out sales)
    - Excluded because missing some sales doesn't pose a great inconvenience to most students.

### Travel

1. [Excluded] Budgeting for a trip
    - Excluded because budgeting is a feature offered by many existing travel related apps.
2. [Excluded] Planning the itinerary for a trip
    - Excluded because there are already many resources for planning and finding things to do when traveling.
3. [Excluded] Planning a group trip
    - Excluded because group trip planning difficulties often stem from varying availabilities and budgets. These issues can't be solved with software.
